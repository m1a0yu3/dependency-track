title: Introduction

Modern applications leverage the availability of existing components for use as building blocks 
in application development. By using existing components, organizations can dramatically decrease
time-to-market. Reusing existing components however, comes at a cost. Organizations that build on 
top of existing components assume risk for software they did not create. Vulnerabilities in third-party
components are inherited by all applications that use those components. The [OWASP Top Ten] (2013 and 2017)
both recognize the risk of [using components with known vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities).

Dependency-Track is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) platform that keeps track of all third-party 
components used in all the applications an organization creates or consumes. It integrates with multiple
vulnerability databases including the [National Vulnerability Database] (NVD), [NPM Public Advisories] (NPM),
[Sonatype OSS Index], and [VulnDB] from [Risk Based Security]. Dependency-Track monitors all applications in its portfolio in order
to proactively identify vulnerabilities in components that are placing your applications at risk. Use of 
Dependency-Track can play a vital role in an overall [Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-Management) (C-SCRM) 
program by fulfilling many of the recommendations laid out by [SAFECode](https://www.safecode.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SAFECode_TPC_Whitepaper.pdf).

Dependency-Track is designed to be used in an automated DevOps environment where BoM (bill-of-material) formats are 
automatically ingested during CI/CD. Use of the [Dependency-Track Jenkins Plugin] is highly recommended for this purpose 
and is well suited for use in [Jenkins Pipeline]. In such an environment, Dependency-Track enables your DevOps teams to 
accelerate while still keeping tabs on component usage and any inherited risk.

Dependency-Track can also be used to monitor vulnerabilities in COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) software.
